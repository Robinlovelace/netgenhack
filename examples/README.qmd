In preparation for the hackathon it's probably worth:

- Taking a read of the [github.com/Robinlovelace/netgenhack/](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/netgenhack/) README and examples
- Clone the repo and 'join', you should see an invite if you go to https://github.com/Robinlovelace/netgenhack/invitations
- Checking out the [`od2net`](https://github.com/Urban-Analytics-Technology-Platform/od2net) codebase and getting it running locally
- Check out network simplification writings, in the https://nptscot.github.io/networkmerge/ webset and the [rnetmatch](https://github.com/nptscot/rnetmatch) repository
- Read-up on OSM2AT at [github.com/acteng/OSM2AT](https://github.com/acteng/OSM2AT)

Any issues getting access to the repo or any other questions let me know in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/netgenhack/issues).
